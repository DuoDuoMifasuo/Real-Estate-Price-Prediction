# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

Overview
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using a linear regression model. It's designed to demonstrate the application of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation techniques in Python.

Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will need the following packages:

numpy
pandas
sklearn
statsmodels
You can install these packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn statsmodels
Usage
The notebook is divided into several steps, each illustrating a specific part of the machine learning workflow:

Step 1: Import the required packages
This step involves importing necessary Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, sklearn, and statsmodels.

Step 2: Prepare the Data & Data Preprocessing
Data is loaded from a CSV file named 'Real estate.csv'.
Certain columns are dropped for preprocessing, and the dataset is prepared for the model.
Null values in each column are checked and handled accordingly.
Step 3: Building the Linear Model
A linear regression model is built using sklearn and statsmodels to predict real estate prices based on the processed data.
Data Description
The dataset 'Real estate.csv' contains several features that are used to predict the real estate prices. The specific features used and their description will be detailed further in the notebook.
